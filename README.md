Mirrored keymaps
================

These can be used for one-handed typing, for example using the following
command:

```
setxkbmap -layout "gb,gb_mirrored" -option "grp:lswitch,grp:switch"
```

This will mirror the keyboard while holding one of the alt keys, allowing you
to easily reach the keys on the right side of the keyboard with your left hand
and vice versa.

Enjoy!
